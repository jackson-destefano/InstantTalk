InstantTalk
===========

Peer-to-peer bluetooth voice chat for iOS 5+. Automatic connection, no pairing required. Designed for motorcycle rider to passenger communication. For best results, use with noise cancelling earphones.

Do you live on two wheels with a little motor? Don't get lonely - take a passenger and stay chatting even though you're wearing a tight fitting helmet and passing through strong winds. No more confusing taps on the shoulders, twisting your head backwards and missing turns!

Load the app on two or more devices, open it up and chat on your private line. MotoChat uses Bluetooth so you will never have to worry about cell tower coverage, airtime charges, data usage or roaming fees. Works both in the dense cities and out in the middle of nowhere. 

MotoChat was designed to require minimal user interaction - just open it and let it connect - no complicated set up procedures.

Plus you can still multitask and even listen to music in the background. Just press the middle button on your headset and enjoy your tunes.
